## [./1-RecSys/RecSys.ipynb](RecSys.ipynb)
This first lab is aiming to create a recomendation system and to evaluate it on a LastFM listening Dataset, using the matrix decomposition algorithm, which is pretty efficient and easy to implement. 

Improvements to the model and experiments are given at the end of the notebooks
## [./2-MC/MC.ipynb](MC.ipynb)
This lab is about the Monte-Carlo decision algorithm.
## [./3-HousePricing/HousePricing.ipynb](HousePricing.ipynb)
Determine the price of Houses based on training data.
