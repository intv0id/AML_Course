> The goal of this course is mainly to offer data science projects to students to gain hands-on experience. 
> It nicely merges the theoretical concepts students can learn in our courses on machine learning and statistical inference, and systems concepts taught in distributed systems.
>
> Notebooks require to address several challenges, that can be roughly classified in:
>
> * Data preparation and cleaning
> * Building descriptive statistics of the data
> * Working on a selected algorithm, e.g., for building a statistical model, for running parallel Monte Carlo simulations and so on...
> * Working on experimental validation
