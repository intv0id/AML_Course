## 1 - [RecSys](https://github.com/intv0id/AML_Course/tree/master/1-RecSys)

This first lab is aiming to create a recomendation system and to evaluate it on a LastFM listening Dataset, using the matrix decomposition algorithm, which is pretty efficient and easy to implement. 

Improvements to the model and experiments are given at the end of the notebooks

## 2 - [MC](https://github.com/intv0id/AML_Course/tree/master/2-MC)

This lab is about the Monte-Carlo decision algorithm.
