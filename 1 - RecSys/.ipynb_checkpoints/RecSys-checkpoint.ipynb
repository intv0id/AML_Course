    "# Building a music recommender system\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name implies, a recommender system is a tool that helps predicting what a user may or may not like among a list of given items. In some sense, you can view this as an alternative to content search, as recommendation engines help users discover products or content that they may not come across otherwise. For example, Facebook suggests friends and pages to users. Youtube recommends videos which users may be interested in. Amazon suggests the products which users may need... Recommendation engines engage users to services, can be seen as a revenue optimization process, and in general help maintaining interest in a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we study how to build a simple recommender system: we focus on music recommendations, and we use a simple algorithm to predict which items users might like, that is called ALS, alternating least squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we expect students to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Revisit (or learn) recommender algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the idea of Matrix Factorization and the ALS algorithm (serial and parallel versions)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a simple model for a real usecase: music recommender system\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to validate the results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume students to work outside lab hours on the learning material. These are the steps by which we guide students, during labs, to build a good basis for the end-to-end development of a recommender system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inspect the data using Spark SQL, and build some basic, but very valuable knowledge about the information we have at hand\n",
    "* Formally define what is a sensible algorithm to achieve our goal: given the \"history\" of user taste for music, recommend new music to discover. Essentialy, we want to build a statistical model of user preferences such that we can use it to \"predict\" which additional music the user could like\n",
    "* With our formal definition at hand, we will learn different ways to implement such an algorithm. Our goal here is to illustrate what are the difficulties to overcome when implementing a (parallel) algorithm\n",
    "* Finally, we will focus on an existing implementation, available in the Apache Spark MLLib, which we will use out of the box to build a reliable statistical model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may think at this point we will be done!\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you'd better think twice: one important topic we will cover in all our Notebooks is **how to validate the results we obtain**, and **how to choose good parameters to train models** especially when using an \"opaque\" library for doing the job. As a consequence, we will focus on the statistical validation of our recommender system.\n"

    "# 1. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding data is one of the most important part when designing any machine learning algorithm. In this notebook, we will use a data set published by Audioscrobbler - a music recommendation system for last.fm. Audioscrobbler is also one of the first internet streaming radio sites, founded in 2002. It provided an open API for “scrobbling”, or recording listeners’ plays of artists’ songs. last.fm used this information to build a powerful music recommender engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Data schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a rating dataset which contains information about users' preference for products (one star, 3 stars, and so on), the datasets from Audioscrobbler only has information about events: specifically, it keeps track of how many times a user played songs of a given artist and the names of artists. That means it carries less information than a rating: in the literature, this is called explicit vs. implicit ratings.\n",

Since we do not have time information associated to our data, we can only build a, e.g., top-10 ranking of the most popular artists in the dataset.

This means we have to be careful when establishing popular artists. Indeed, artists whose data is \"well formed\" will have the correct number of play counts associated to them.

    "    This has to do with the time spent on the LastFM platform. Multiple behaviours can be observed:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>Some users are very curious and spend a lot of time looking for new songs and to widen the range of their listenings. Those users are very useful for the recommendation system as they realy improve the accuracy of the prediction, by making the utility matrix warmer (less sparse) ; their rating (here number of listening) is then very usefull. However, the drawback is that a recommendation system leads to reduce the variety of their listening by predicting what they want to listen and therefore to reduce their curiosity. This can leads to entire parts of the matrix that are unexplored by users if they only follow the recommendation system.</li>\n",
    "        <li>Some users juste loop-play the music they already know. Those users doesn't contribute much to improve the utility matrix, but may be more likely to benefit from the recommendation system.</li>\n",

    "The huge majority of users have a limited number of play each (typically, 95% of the users have an individual play count of less than 20000).\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    As said in the previous question, some users interracts a lot with the systems. Those users will benefits and contribute a lot to the recommendaton system. The users that don't contribute much to the system, listening to music, or the new users will have biaised recommendations or too generic recommendations:<br>\n",
    "    An user that have no contribution will have generic prediction based on the whole system as for the \"most viewed\" homepage in YouTube.<br>\n",
    "    Some users that contributed too few will have their recommendation based only on their contribution, which can be on the boundaries of what they like, or not focused on the typical listening they want. In that case the recommendation system which is collaborative and therefore based on other users feedback will not associate this user to the right group of users which would give good answers.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <b>Example:</b> An user with 3 listening, 1 on something he doesn't like (e.g hard-rock) and listened for some random reason, and 2 things he likes (e.g generic, well known classical music) will have biaised recommended content as hard-rock remix of classical music, if the users he is associated are listening this knid of music. <br>\n",

    "## 2.1 Introduction to recommender systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recommendation-system application there are two classes of entities, which we shall refer to as `users` and `items`. Users have preferences for certain items, and these preferences must be inferred from the data. The data itself is represented as a `preference matrix` $A$, giving for each user-item pair, a value that represents what is known about the degree of preference of that user for that item. The table below is an example for a `preference matrix` of 5 users and `k` items. The `preference matrix` is also known as `utility matrix`.\n",
    "\n",
    "| | IT1 | IT2 | IT3 | ... | ITk |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| U1 | 1 |  | 5 | ... | 3 |\n",
    "| U2 |  | 2 |  | ... | 2 |\n",
    "| U3 | 5 |  | 3 | ... |  |\n",
    "| U4 | 3 | 3 |  | ... | 4 |\n",
    "| U5 |  | 1 |  | ... | ... |\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of row i, column j expresses how much does user `i` like item `j`. The values are often the rating scores of users for items. An unknown value implies that we have no explicit information about the user's preference for the item. The goal of a recommendation system is to predict \"the blanks\" in the `preference matrix`. For example, assume that the rating score is from 1 (dislike) to 5 (love), would user `U5` like `IT3` ? We have two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Designing our recommendation system to take into account properties of items such as brand, category, price... or even the similarity of their names. We can denote the similarity of items `IT2` and `IT3`, and then conclude that because user `U5` did not like `IT2`, they were unlikely to enjoy SW2 either.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We might observe that the people who rated both `IT2` and `IT3` tended to give them similar ratings. Thus, we could conclude that user `U5` would also give `IT3` a low rating, similar to `U5`'s rating of `IT2`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not necessary to predict every blank entry in a `utility matrix`. Rather, it is only necessary to discover some entries in each row that are likely to be high. In most applications, the recommendation system does not oﬀer users a ranking of all items, but rather suggests a few that the user should value highly. It may not even be necessary to ﬁnd all items with the highest expected ratings, but only to ﬁnd a large subset of those with the highest ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Families of recommender systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, recommender systems can be categorized into two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Content-Based** systems focus on properties of items. Similarity of items is determined by measuring the similarity in their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Collaborative-Filtering** systems focus on the relationship between users and items. Similarity of items is determined by the similarity of the ratings of those items by the users who have rated both items.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the usecase of this notebook, artists take the role of `items`, and `users` keep the same role as `users`.\n",
    "Since we have no information about `artists`, except their names, we cannot build a `content-based` recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in the rest of this notebook, we only focus on `Collaborative-Filtering` algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Collaborative-Filtering \n",
    "In this section, we study a member of a broad class of algorithms called `latent-factor` models. They try to explain observed interactions between large numbers of users and products through a relatively small number of unobserved, underlying reasons. It is analogous to explaining why millions of people buy a particular few of thousands of possible albums by describing users and albums in terms of tastes for perhaps tens of genres, tastes which are **not directly observable or given** as data. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we formulate the learning problem as a matrix completion problem. Then, we will use a type of `matrix factorization` model to \"fill in\" the blanks.  We are given implicit ratings that users have given certain items (that is, the number of times they played a particular artist) and our goal is to predict their ratings for the rest of the items. Formally, if there are $n$ users and $m$ items, we are given an $n \\times m$ matrix $R$ in which the generic entry $(u, i)$ represents the rating for item $i$ by user $u$. **Matrix $R$ has many missing entries indicating unobserved ratings, and our task is to estimate these unobserved ratings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular approach to the matrix completion problem is **matrix factorization**, where we want to \"summarize\" users and items with their **latent factors**.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several ways to distribute the computation of the ALS algorithm depending on how data is partitioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 1: using joins\n",
    "First we consider a fully distributed version, in the sense that all data (both input and output) is stored in a distributed file system. In practice, input data (ratings) and parameters ($X$ and $Y$) are stored in an a Spark RDD. Specifically, ratings -- that are always **sparse** -- are stored as RDD of triplets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratings: RDD((u, i, $r_{ui}$), . . . )\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can use dense representation for factor matrices $X$ and $Y$, and these are stored as RDDs of vectors. More precisely, we can use the data types introduced in Spark MLLib to store such vectors and matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "X : RDD($x_1$,...,$x_n$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Y : RDD($y_1$,...,$y_m$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, recall the expression to compute $x_u$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_u = \\left( \\sum_{r_ui \\in r_{u*}} y_i y_{i}^{T} + \\lambda I_k \\right)^{-1} \\sum_{r_ui \\in r_{u*}} r_{ui} y_i $ \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call the first summation *part A* and the second summation *part B*. To compute such parts, in parallel, we can proceed with the following high-level pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Join the Ratings RDD with the $Y$ matrix RDD using key $i$ (items)\n",
    "* Map to compute $y_i y_{i}^{T}$ and emit using key $u$ (user)\n",
    "* ReduceByKey $u$ (user) to compute $\\sum_{r_ui \\in r_{u*}} y_i y_{i}^{T}$\n",
    "* Invert\n",
    "* Another ReduceByKey $u$ (user) to compute $\\sum_{r_ui \\in r_{u*}} r_{ui} y_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the same template to copmute $y_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach works fine, but note it requires computing $y_i y_{i}^{T}$ for each user that has rated item $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 2: using broadcast variables (advanced topic)\n",
    "The next approach takes advantage of the fact that the $X$ and $Y$ factor matrices are often very small and can be stored locally on each machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Partition the Ratings RDD **by user** to create $R_1$, and similarly partition the Ratings RDD **by item** to create $R_2$. This means there are two copies of the same Ratings RDD, albeit with different partitionings. In $R_1$, all ratings by the same user are on the same machine, and in $R_2$ all ratings for same item are on the same machine.\n",
    "* Broadcast the matrices $X$ and $Y$. Note that these matrices are not RDD of vectors: they are now \"local: matrices.\n",
    "* Using $R_1$ and $Y$, we can use expression $x_u$ from above to compute the update of $x_u$ locally on each machine\n",
    "* Using $R_2$ and $X$, we can use expression $y_i$ from above to compute the update of $y_i$ locally on each machine\n",
    "\n",
    "A further optimization to this method is to group the $X$ and $Y$ factors matrices into blocks (user blocks and item blocks) and reduce the communication by only sending to each machine the block of users (or items) that are needed to compute the updates at that machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method is called **Block ALS**. It is achieved by precomputing some information about the ratings matrix to determine the \"out-links\" of each user (which blocks of the items it will contribute to) and \"in-link\" information for each item (which of the factor vectors it receives from each user block it will depend on). For exmple, assume that machine 1 is responsible for users 1,2,...,37: these will be block 1 of users. The items rated by these users are block 1 of items. Only the factors of block 1 of users and block 1 of items will be broadcasted to machine 1.\n",

    "# 3. Usecase : Music recommender system\n",
    "\n",
    "In this usecase, we use the data of users and artists in the previous sections to build a statistical model to recommend artists for users.\n",
    " \n",
    "## 3.1 Requirements\n",
    "According to the properties of data, we need to choose a recommender algorithm that is suitable for this implicit feedback data. It means that the algorithm should learn without access to user or artist attributes such as age, genre,.... Therefore, an algorithm of type `collaborative filtering` is the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, in the data, there are some users that have listened to only 1 artist. We need an algorithm that might provide decent recommendations to even these users. After all, at some point, every user starts out with just one play at some point! \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we need an algorithm that scales, both in its ability to build large models, and to create recommendations quickly. So, an algorithm which can run on a distributed system (SPARK, Hadoop...) is very suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these requirement, we can choose using ALS algorithm in SPARK's MLLIB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark MLlib’s ALS implementation draws on ideas from [1](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf) and [2](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-68880-8_32).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, MLLIB can only build models from an RDD. That means we have two ways to prepare data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loading to into SPARK SQL DataFrame as before, and then access the corresponding RDD by calling `<dataframe>.rdd`. The invalid data is often sucessfully dropped by using mode `DROPMALFORMED`. However, this way might not work in all cases. Fortunately, we can use it with this usecase.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loading data directly to RDD. However, we have to deal with the invalid data ourself. In the trade-off, this way is the most reliable, and can work in every case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use the second approach: it requires a bit more effort, but the reward is worth it!\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## 3.3 Cleanup the data\n",
    "In section 1, we already replaced the ids of mispelled artists by the corresponding standard ids by using SPARK SQL API.\n",
    "However, if the data has the invalid entries such that SPARK SQL API is stuck, the best way to work with it is using an RDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as a recall, we work with three datasets in `user_artist_data.txt`, `` and `artist_alias.txt`. The entries in these file can be empty or have only one field. \n",
    "\n",
    "In details our goal now is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read the input ```user_artist_data.txt``` and transforms its representation into an output dataset.\n",
    "* To produce an output \"tuple\" containing the original user identifier and play counts, but with the artist identifier replaced by its most common alias, as found in the ```artist_alias.txt``` dataset.\n",
    "* Since the ```artist_alias.txt``` file is small, we can use a technique called **broadcast variables** to make such transformation more efficient.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this section, we study how to evaluate the quality of our model. It's hard to say how good the recommendations are.\n",
    "One of serveral methods approach to evaluate  a recommender based on its ability to rank good items (artists) high in a list of recommendations. The problem is how to define \"good artists\". Currently, by training all data, \"good artists\" is defined as \"artists the user has listened to\", and the recommender system has already received all of this information as input. It could trivially return the users previously-listened artists as top recommendations and score perfectly. Indeed, this is not useful, because the recommender's is used to recommend artists that the user has **never** listened to. \n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome that problem, we can hide the some of the artist play data and only use the rest to train model. Then, this held-out data can be interpreted as a collection of \"good\" recommendations for each user. The recommender is asked to rank all items in the model, and the rank of the held-out artists are examined. Ideally the recommender places all of them at or near the top of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommender's score can then be computed by comparing all held-out artists' ranks to the rest.  The fraction of pairs where the held-out artist is ranked higher is its score. 1.0 is perfect, 0.0 is the worst possible score, and 0.5 is the expected value achieved from randomly ranking artists. \n",
    "\n",
    "AUC(Area Under the Curve) can be used as a metric to evaluate model. It is also viewed as the probability that a randomly-chosen \"good\" artist ranks above a randomly-chosen \"bad\" artist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we split the training data into 2 parts: `trainData` and `cvData` with ratio 0.9:0.1 respectively, where `trainData` is the dataset that will be used to train model. Then we write a function to calculate AUC to evaluate the quality of our model.\n"
